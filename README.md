# Project-RPG
This is a text-based RPG game created in C++ where the player battles monsters in a turn-based system. 

## Functionality
The player can attack, defend, use items, or change equipment during their turn, while monsters respond with their own attacks. The game includes level scaling, coin rewards, and a shop where the player can buy weapons, armor, and items between battles. The game will function with a simple menu of decisions that allows the player to choose what they do, and the shop will work in a similar way, but it will display the available items to the player.
